Less
----

Presentation for the [Brisbane Wed Design Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/The-Brisbane-Web-Design-Meetup-Group/) on the [Less](http://lesscss.org) stylesheeting language.

This repository contains sample Less projects to get you started. For a simple project within minimal HTML and CSS
check out the __src/simple__ project directory. There you'll find both the javascript and compiled css versions of the project.

I have also included a simplified version of Alexis Sellier's [cloudhead.io](http://cloudhead.io) website. The __src/cloudhead__ project directory stores this example which includes the original CSS, and the Less versions with javascript and with compiled
css.
